### Key Changes Made

1. **Project Configuration**
   - Added `foundry.toml` configuration
   - Added `remappings.txt` for dependency resolution
   - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude Foundry artifacts

2. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Created `test-foundry/` directory for Foundry tests
   - Added `TestHelpers.sol` base contract with common utilities
   - Migrated all test files with Foundry conventions

3. **Mock Contracts**
   - Fixed `USDCLikePermitMock` to support both EOA and contract signatures
   - Created helper contracts where needed for proper test isolation

4. **Package.json Updates**
   - Added Foundry test scripts
   - Maintained existing Hardhat scripts

### Notable Implementation Details

1. **Memory vs Storage Differences**
   - Documented in `FOUNDRY_MEMORY_DIFFERENCES.md`
   - Key finding: Solidity 0.8.24 enforces memory-safe assembly

2. **Test Adaptations**
   - `BySig` test: Created wallet with correct ownership
   - `EthReceiver` test: Adjusted for Foundry's execution context
   - `SafeERC20` test: Created modified wrapper for proper spender handling
   - `RevertReasonForwarder` test: Made helper contract payable

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all Foundry tests
npm run test:foundry

# Run all Hardhat tests
npm test

# Run both test suites
npm run test:all

# Run specific Foundry test file
forge test --match-path test-foundry/SafeERC20.t.sol

# Run with gas reporting
npm run forge:test:gas

# Run with coverage
npm run forge:test:coverage
```

### Next Steps

1. Consider removing Hardhat tests after team validation
2. Set up CI/CD to run both test suites
3. Monitor gas usage differences between implementations
4. Consider migrating deployment scripts to Foundry

### Benefits of Foundry

- Faster test execution (native EVM implementation)
- Better debugging with stack traces
- Built-in fuzzing capabilities
- More accurate gas measurements
- Snapshot testing for complex state changes
- Better cheat codes for test scenarios
