### safeBalanceOf

```solidity
function safeBalanceOf(contract IERC20 token, address account) internal view returns (uint256 tokenBalance)
```
Fetches the balance of a specific ERC20 token held by an account.
Consumes less gas then regular `ERC20.balanceOf`.

_Note that the implementation does not perform dirty bits cleaning, so it is the
responsibility of the caller to make sure that the higher 96 bits of the `account` parameter are clean._

### safePermit

```solidity
function safePermit(contract IERC20 token, bytes permit) internal
```
Attempts to execute the `permit` function on the provided token with the sender and contract as parameters.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| token | contract IERC20 | The IERC20 token to execute the permit function on. |
| permit | bytes | The permit data to be used in the function call. |

### safePermit

```solidity
function safePermit(contract IERC20 token, address owner, address spender, bytes permit) internal
```
Attempts to execute the `permit` function on the provided token with custom owner and spender parameters.
Permit type is determined automatically based on permit calldata (IERC20Permit, IDaiLikePermit, and IPermit2).

_Wraps `tryPermit` function and forwards revert reason if permit fails.
Note that the implementation does not perform dirty bits cleaning, so it is the responsibility of
the caller to make sure that the higher 96 bits of the `owner` and `spender` parameters are clean._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| token | contract IERC20 | The IERC20 token to execute the permit function on. |
| owner | address | The owner of the tokens for which the permit is made. |
| spender | address | The spender allowed to spend the tokens by the permit. |
| permit | bytes | The permit data to be used in the function call. |

### tryPermit

```solidity
function tryPermit(contract IERC20 token, bytes permit) internal returns (bool success)
```
Attempts to execute the `permit` function on the provided token with the sender and contract as parameters.

_Invokes `tryPermit` with sender as owner and contract as spender._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| token | contract IERC20 | The IERC20 token to execute the permit function on. |
| permit | bytes | The permit data to be used in the function call. |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
success | bool | Returns true if the permit function was successfully executed, false otherwise. |

### tryPermit

```solidity
function tryPermit(contract IERC20 token, address owner, address spender, bytes permit) internal returns (bool success)
```
The function attempts to call the permit function on a given ERC20 token.

_The function is designed to support a variety of permit functions, namely: IERC20Permit, IDaiLikePermit, IERC7597Permit and IPermit2.
It accommodates both Compact and Full formats of these permit types.
Please note, it is expected that the `expiration` parameter for the compact Permit2 and the `deadline` parameter
for the compact Permit are to be incremented by one before invoking this function. This approach is motivated by
gas efficiency considerations; as the unlimited expiration period is likely to be the most common scenario, and
zeros are cheaper to pass in terms of gas cost. Thus, callers should increment the expiration or deadline by one
before invocation for optimized performance.
Note that the implementation does not perform dirty bits cleaning, so it is the responsibility of
the caller to make sure that the higher 96 bits of the `owner` and `spender` parameters are clean._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| token | contract IERC20 | The address of the ERC20 token on which to call the permit function. |
| owner | address | The owner of the tokens. This address should have signed the off-chain permit. |
| spender | address | The address which will be approved for transfer of tokens. |
| permit | bytes | The off-chain permit data, containing different fields depending on the type of permit function. |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
success | bool | A boolean indicating whether the permit call was successful. |
